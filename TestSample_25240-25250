## Known issues in 25250.000
[25250.000] Missing country exonyms for Anguilla, Grenada & República Dominicana
[25250.000] Address Points for following countries are sourced from OSM and they are not standardized to the Orbis Address Points product specification: ABW, AFG, AGO, AIA, ALB, ARM, ATA, ATF, ATG, BDI, BEN, BES, BFA, BGD, BHS, BLM, BLZ, BMU, BOL, BRB, BTN, BWA, CAF, CIV, CMR, COD, COG, COK, COM, CPV, CRI, CUB, CUW, CYM, DJI, DMA, DOM, ERI, ETH, FJI, FLK, FSM, GHA, GIB, GIN, GMB, GNB, GNQ, GRD, GRL, GUY, HND, HTI, IOT, IRN, IRQ, JAM, JPN, KAZ, KEN, KGZ, KIR, KNA, LBR, LBY, LCA, LSO, MAF, MDG, MDV, MHL, MLI, MNE, MNG, MOZ, MRT, MSR, MUS, MWI, NCL, NER, NGA, NIC, NIU, NPL, NRU, OMN, PAK, PAN, PCN, PLW, PNG, PRK, PSE, PYF, RWA, SDN, SEN, SGS, SHN, SLB, SLE, SLV, SOM, SPM, SSD, STP, SUR, SWZ, SXM, SYC, SYR, TCA, TCD, TGO, TJK, TKL, TKM, TLS, TON, TTO, TUV, TZA, UGA, UMI, UZB, VAT, VCT, VEN, VGB, VUT, WLF, WSM, XAM, XAN, XCP, XHT, XTU, XXS, YEM, ZMB, ZWE. The normalization of Address Points to Orbis Product Specification in these countries will be done in subsequent releases.
[25250.000] The waterbelt area of a country is not part of any administrative region of the country. The problem doesn't exist for USA, but exists for multiple other countries.
[25250.000] There is a reduction of Payment Method attribution for Fuel Stations in AUT, BEL, BRA, CZE, DEU, FIN, HRV, ITA, SVN. A fix plan is being defined.
[25250.000] The number of A101 branded POIs in TUR, Santander in USA, and Costco in USA has decreased. A fix plan is being defined.
[25250.000] Approximately 30,000 superfluous Address Points were removed in Puerto Rico, enhancing the quality of addressing content. These Address Points were removed as they did not correspond to real-world addresses.
[25250.000] Some areas USA lack short names populated and only have primary normalized names.

[25240.000] Approximately 1.05 million superfluous addresses in Argentina have been deleted as part of the week 24 release. The planned deletion was communicated earlier via Alert Ticket on June 4, 2025. This cleanup enhances the overall quality of our addressing content, as these address points were either of poor quality or did not exist in reality.
[25240.000] Due to discontinued supplier, ~ 1700 petrol stations have been removed from FR/FRA (11% of total). This has almost no impact on POI availability, but investigation is ongoing to recover valuable lost petrol stations.
[25240.000] Some areas USA lack short names populated and only have primary normalized names.
[25240.000] Approximately 7.1 million superfluous addresses in the USA have been deleted as part of the week 24 release. The planned deletion was communicated earlier via Alert Ticket on June 4, 2025. This cleanup enhances the overall quality of our addressing content, as these address points were either of poor quality or did not exist in reality.

[25250.000]Overture GERS IDs are updated according to the UUIDv4 aligned with the latest Overture release. Overture Maps Foundation provides mapping files for migration from old GERS IDs to new GERS IDs (based on UUIDv4), for more info check Overture Maps Foundation website.

[25250.000]To improve user experience, French exonyms have been added for place names (e.g. Administrative Areas and Place Points) and place names used as POI name in AUT, DEU, DNK, ESP, GRC, MLT, NLD, POL, PRT, SMR, SWE & USA.

[25250.000]The number of SUBWAY branded POIs increased in CHL, COL, MEX, PRI, THA.
[25250.000]Approx. 700k extra healthcare:specialityproperties have been added to Clinic and Hospital POIs.
[25250.000]~2M Routing Points of POIs, which are having onsite parking lots, have been relocated to a parking entrance location.
[25250.000]As a result of cleaning up superfluous data, there is a decrease of Car Dealer and Market POIs. The main impact is for following countries: HUN, TUR, AUS, NLD, SWE.
[25250.000]Accuracy of Routing Points of Parking Facility POIs has been improved globally. It impacts approx. 15k Routings Points.
[25250.000]More POI names in local languages have been added. The biggest impact is in following countries: 160k names in TWN, 32k in SAU, 26k in ARE, 11k in THA.
[25250.000]Presence of multilingual addresses is improved in SAU. Now 83% of POIs are having addresses in required languages ("ar_Arab","ar_Latn","en_Latn","unspecified").
[25250.000]There is an increase in a number of Tourism=attraction POIs as a result of changes in the conflation logic, where Tourism=attraction category is selected as a primary one. As a consequence of this, there is a decrease of POIs which have a primary category as Museum, or Gallery. These categories are produced as alternative ones.
[25250.000]The POIs with personal names in countries PRT, CZE, GRC, MKD (except public transport and clinics) will be placed in fallout with “poi_name_is_person_name" The number of POIs going to fallback by country. MKD 60 PRT 748, GRC 1451 CZE 8956

[25240.000]For the speed-profiles, we have extended the set of ways for which we have not specified a direction within the tag key to include all one-way roads. In line with Orbis specifications, the given values can then be used for valid drivingdirection(s).
The Overture Maps Foundation (OMF) has made a decision to recalculate the GERS IDs from the existing schema to UUIDv4. Consequently, in this Orbis release and in all subsequent releases until early July, GERS IDs currently associated with the Transportation network as tags (key-value pairs) will be filtered out. The new GERS IDs, which will be based on UUIDs, will be available following the official launch after the Overture June release. It is important to note that this change will not affect the Orbis Product IDs and is solely related to the GERS ID tags.
Regular monthly maintenance on speed-profiles which results in updates on a significant share of all ways (>50%). This is a planned and validated update.

[25240.000] In week 16 the algorithm for Routing Point (RP) creation was modified, but it delivered some edge cases which did not get improved RP location. these edge cases are now solved. 1,4M POIs had their RPs updated. The total number of RRPs that are merged with GRPs now is 9,9M.
[25240.000] A cleanup for Routing Points (RP) regarding underground parking has been completed, and RP from the source is now permitted to be placed on alleys. This change has affected 8K POIs.
[25240.000] Due to better distinguishing between highway=services and highway=rest_area some POIs in these categories were shifted:highway=rest_area: 35528 → 50411,highway=services: 54712 → 39722.
[25240.000] The confidence model has been upgraded from 1.3 to 1.4 version. This will impact the confidence score of 126M POIs.
[25240.000] The number of duplicated POIs Artificial category groups has been reduced globally, as a result of the expansion of Machine Learning matching model. This causes changes in POI counts and POI category values.
