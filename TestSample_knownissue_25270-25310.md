## Known issues in 25310.000  
General  
geocoding  
[25310.000]Potential duplicate Address Points have been identified in the following countries: IRL, AND, SMR, PRT, ITA, ESP, BRA, CYP, MCO, FRA, HUN, GRC, BEL, USA. The exact count of duplicates is currently being thoroughly checked by the TomTom Addressing Team against our Address Point sources. The count of duplicates could be between 1%-3% in each country, but it can only be confirmed once thorough validation is done. In the USA, the count is likely to be < 0.5%. In IRL (Ireland), PRT (Portugal), AND (Andorra) and SMR (San Marino), the count of duplicates is likely to be higher (i.e. > ~5%). There could be other countries with duplicate APTs, but we expect the % to be significantly lower. Once the count is confirmed for each country, we will provide detailed information about the number of duplicates and their removal via weekly Orbis release notes.
